The only information on Kim Jong-un\'s early life comes from North Korean defectors and people who have claimed to witness him abroad, such as during his school attendance in Switzerland. North Korean authorities have stated that his birthdate is 8 January 1982, but South Korean intelligence officials believe the actual date is a year later. Dennis Rodman said that the birthdate is 8 January 1983 after meeting Kim in September 2013.Kim Jong-Un was the second of three children Ko Yong-hui bore to Kim Jong-il; his elder brother Kim Jong-chul was born in 1981, while his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, is believed to have been born in 1987.</br></br><hr>

Kim Jong-un attended the Liebefeld Steinhölzli school in Köniz near Bern under the name "Pak-un" or "Un-pak" from 1998 until 2000 as the son of an employee of the Embassy of North Korea. Authorities of Köniz confirmed that a student from North Korea, registered as the son of a member of the Embassy, attended the school from August 1998 until the autumn of 2000. Pak-un first attended a special class for foreign-language children and later attended the regular classes of the 6th, 7th, 8th, and part of the final 9th year. He was described as a well-integrated and ambitious student who liked to play basketball. However, his grades and attendance rating are reported to have been poor. The ambassador of North Korea in Switzerland, Ri Tcheul, had a close relationship with him and acted as a mentor. Jong-un was described by classmates as a shy child who was awkward with girls and indifferent to political issues but who distinguished himself in sports.</br></br><hr>

Kim Jong-un was made a daejang, the equivalent of a four-star general in the United States, on 27 September 2010, a day ahead of a rare Workers\' Party of Korea conference in Pyongyang, the first time North Korean media had mentioned him by name and despite his having no previous military experience. </br></br>
On 10 October 2010, alongside his father, Kim Jong-un attended the ruling Workers\' Party\'s 65th anniversary celebration. This was seen as fully confirming his position as the next leader of the Workers\' Party. Unprecedented international press access was granted to the event, further indicating the importance of Kim Jong-un\'s presence. In January 2011, the regime began purging around 200 protégés of both Jong-un\'s uncle-in-law Jang Sung-taek and O Kuk-ryol, the vice chairman of the National Defence Commission of North Korea, by either detention or execution to further prevent either man from rivaling Jong-un. In the following months, Kim Jong-un was given more and more prominence as he accompanied Kim Jong-il during several "guidance tours" and received gifts from foreign delegations and personages, an honor traditionally awarded only to the living supreme leader.</br></br>

On 17 December 2011, Kim Jong-il died.Despite the elder Kim\'s plans, it was not immediately clear after his death whether Jong-un would in fact take full power, and what his exact role in a new government would be.</br></br>

He was publicly declared Supreme Commander of the Korean People\'s Army on 24 December 2011 and formally appointed to the position on 30 December when the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers\' Party "courteously proclaimed that the dear respected Kim Jong Un, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK, assumed the supreme commandership of the Korean People\'s Army".</br></br>

On 9 January 2012, a large rally was held by Korean People\'s Army in front of Kumsusan Memorial Palace to honor Kim Jong-un and demonstrate loyalty.</br></br>
