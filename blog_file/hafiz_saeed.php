In April 2012, the United States announced a bounty of $10 million on Hafiz Saeed, for his alleged role in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks in which 6 American citizens were killed among hundreds of other victims, but there have been protests in Pakistan against the US bounty.

He has blamed India for the floods in Pakistan, calling it "Water Terrorism". He also blames India for the <font color ="#E53B77"> Peshawar Attack</font> which resulted in 141 deaths and 124 injuries.Pakistani officials have maintained that Saeed is innocent and he has been helping with identification and rehabilitation of former militants. Saeed lives in <b>Lahore</b>, Pakistan in a fortified house, office and mosque. He gives interviews to media, including the <font color ="#386bca"> New York Times newspaper</font>.</br></br>


<b><u>Background</b></u><hr/>
Hafiz Muhammad Saeed was born in a<font color = "#386bca"> Gujjar </font>family in <font color = "#386bca">  Sargodha, Punjab</font>. As told by him, Kamal-ud-Din, a farmer, in the autumn of 1947, his family started migrating from Haryana and reached Pakistan in around four months. His family lost 36 of its members when migrating from <b>Hisar, Haryana to Lahore </b> during the <font color = "#386bca">Partition of India</font>. He was married to his former wife whose name is Maimoona.</br></br>

<b>General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq appointed Hafiz Muhammad Saeed to the Council on Islamic Ideology, and he later served as an Islamic Studies teacher at the <font color = "#386bca"> University of Engineering and Technology</font>, Pakistan. He was sent to<font color = "#5A3BE5"> Saudi Arabia </font> in the early 1980s by the university for higher studies where he met Saudi Sheikhs who were taking part in the Soviet-Afghan war. They inspired him in taking an active role supporting the Mujahideen in Afghanistan.</b></br></br>

In 1987, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, along with <font color = "#386bca"> Abdullah Azzam </font>, founded <font color ="#386bca">Markaz Dawa-Wal-Irshad</font>, a group with roots in the <b>Jamait Ahl-e-Hadis</b>.</br>

This organisation spawned the jihadist group <b>Lashkar-e-Taiba </b>in 1990, with the help of Pakistan\'s Inter Services Intelligence officers.</br></br>

Lashkar\'s primary target is the disputed Indian state of <font color ="#E53B77">Jammu and Kashmir</font>.He is also quoted as saying, "There cannot be any peace while India remains intact. Cut them, cut them so much that they kneel before you and ask for mercy." Hafiz Muhammad Saeed held two master\'s degrees from the <font color ="#E53B77"> University of Punjab</font> and a specialization in Islamic Studies and Arabic Language from <b> King Saud University </b>.</br></br>

<b><u>Activities</b></u><hr/>
<b><font color = "black">1994</font></b></br>
In 1994, Saeed visited the United States and "spoke at Islamic centres in Houston, Chicago and Boston".</br></br>

<b><font color = "black">2001–2002</font></b></br</br>
Pakistan detained Hafiz Muhammad Saeed. on 21 December 2001 in relation to Indian accusations of his involvement with the 13 December 2001 attack on the <b>Lok Sabha</b>. He was held until 31 March 2002, arrested again on 15 May, and was placed under house arrest on 31 October of the same year.</br></br>

<b><font color = "black">2008–2009</font></b></br>
After the <font color ="#3F1ED2">November 2008 Mumbai attacks</font>, India submitted a formal request to the <b>U.N. Security Council</b> to put the group Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Hafiz Muhammad Saeed on the list of individuals and organisations sanctioned by the United Nations for association with terrorism. India has accused the organisation and its leader, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, of being virtually interchangeable with Lashkar-e-Taiba. India said that the close links between the organisations, as well as the 2,500 offices and 11 seminaries that Jamaat-ud-Dawa maintains in Pakistan, "are of immediate concern with regard to their efforts to mobilise and orchestrate terrorist activities." On 10 December 2008, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed denied a link between LeT and JuD in an interview with Pakistan\'s <font color ="#3F1ED2">Geo television </font>stating that "no Lashkar-e-Taiba man is in Jamaat-ud-Dawa and I have never been a chief of Lashkar-e-Taiba."</br></br>

On 11 December 2008, Hafiz Muhammed Saeed was again placed under house arrest when the United Nations declared Jamaat-ud-Dawa to be an LeT front. Hafiz Muhammad Saeed was held in house arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order law, which allows authorities to detain temporarily individuals deemed likely to create disorder, until early June 2009 when the Lahore High Court, deeming the containment to be unconstitutional, ordered Hafiz Muhammad Saeed to be released.India quickly expressed its disappointment with the decision.</br></br>

On 6 July 2009, the Pakistani government filed an appeal of the court\'s decision. Deputy Attorney General Shah Khawar told the Associated Press that "Hafiz Saeed at liberty is a security threat."</br></br>

On 25 August 2009, <b>Interpolissued</b> a<font color ="#3F1ED2"> Red corner notice</font> against Hafiz Saeed, along with <b>Zaki ur Rehman Lakhvi</b>, in response to Indian requests for his <b> extradition</b>.
Hafiz Muhammad Saeed was again placed under house arrest by the Pakistani authorities in September 2009.</br></br>

On 12 October 2009, the Lahore High Court quashed all cases against Hafiz Muhammad Saeed and set him free. The court also notified that Jama\'at-ud-Da\'wah is not a banned organisation and can work freely in Pakistan. Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, one of two judges hearing the case, observed "In the name of terrorism we cannot brutalise the law."</br></br>

<b><u><font color = "black">Indian attempts at extradition</font></b></u></br></br>
On 11 May 2011, in an effort to place pressure on Pakistan, India publicly revealed a list of its <b>50 most wanted fugitives hiding in Pakistan</b>.India believes Hafiz Saeed is a fugitive, but the Indian arrest warrant had no influence in Pakistan and presently has no effect on Saeed\'s movements within Pakistan. Following the Lahore High Court ruling, Saeed has been moving freely around the country. For many years, India has demanded that Saeed be handed over but there is no extradition treaty between the two countries.</br></br>

<b><u><font color = "black">Views</font></b></u></br></br></hr>
<b>Pakistani Government</b></br></br>
Hafiz Saeed has criticised Pakistani leaders and has stated that they should aspire to be more like British Prime Minister <b>David Cameron</b> and London Mayor<b> Boris Johnson</b>. He had declared his admiration for the British Conservative Party along with several Tory MPs when he lodged a petition to the Lahore High Court calling for public officials in Pakistan to tone down their privileged lifestyles.</br></br>

<b>Indian Government</b></br></br>
In January 2013, India\'s then Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde\'s released a statement on the alleged existence of Hindu terrorism as well as the existence of Hindu terror camps on Indian soil, being run and organised by the BJP and the RSS. As a result, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-ud-Dawa welcomed Shinde\'s statements and congratulated him for admitting the existence of Hindu terrorism.</br></br>

<b>In September 2014, Saeed blamed India for "Water Terrorism".Though there was flood crisis in India too, Saeed blamed India for flood crisis in Pakistan.</b></br></br>

Responding to a question about the nuclear warning issued by Indian authorities in <b>Jammu and Kashmir</b> after the<b> 2013 India–Pakistan border </b> incidents, Saeed said that in case of a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, India should distribute nuclear safety pamphlets in Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta rather than in Kashmir.
