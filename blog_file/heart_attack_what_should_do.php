<b>A heart attack occurs when oxygen fails to reach the heart. The vital organ needs oxygen, contained in your blood, which travels through the arteries to the heart. But if an artery has a blockage in it, blood doesn\'t reach the heart and the heart\'s cells die, resulting in a heart attack.</b></br></br>


<b>Heart Attack Symptoms: Knowing What to Look For</b></br>

The symptoms of a heart attack aren\'t always obvious and often differ between men and women. Those symptoms can be subtle — perhaps one reason why some people don\'t make it to an emergency room — or they can be very painful. Knowing what to look for can help you know when to take action for a friend, colleague, or loved one in distress:</br>';

echo'<b>For men:</b> The typical male symptom is a crushing pressure behind the breastbone, also called the sternum. That pressure, Dennison says, can radiate to your arms (often the left arm) and can go into the back, shoulder blades, and jaw. Men suffering a heart attack can break out in a sweat, and sometimes they will pass out.
The onset of pain may be gradual and last several minutes or more. Sometimes the pain fades and comes back.</br></br>

<b>For women:</b> Women can have any of the same symptoms that men experience, but women often have more “atypical” symptoms, such as shortness of breath, and they may feel some indigestion. A woman having a heart attack may also experience pain in her jaw, and could feel a little faint.</br></br>


<h3><b>How To Save Someone\'s Life</b></h3><hr>

<b>Call for an ambulance :</b> Time is of the essence when you\'re dealing with a heart attack. The first thing you want to do is call for an ambulance and then stay at the person\'s side until help arrives.</br></br>

<b>Stay close : </b> Do not leave the person to find medications to give them — this can cause you to delay calling . It\'s better to call for help first; emergency personnel can administer aspirin or any other appropriate treatments.</br></br>';

echo'<b>Give a dose of nitro :</b> If the person has been prescribed nitroglycerin in the past for heart disease, and the medication is close at hand, you can give them a dose.</br></br>

<b>Go for comfort : </b> Make the heart attack victim more comfortable by placing them in a comfortable position, loosening clothing, and staying close to provide reassurance.</br></br>

<b>If needed, give CPR : </b> Studies have shown that CPR given by a bystander can double or triple a victim\'s chance of surviving cardiac arrest. If you are with someone who suddenly collapses, stops breathing, or is unresponsive, start performing hands-only CPR at 100 chest presses a minute with minimal interruptions. It\'s just as effective as standard CPR. Learn more about how to perform CPR by visiting the American Heart Association\'s Web site or by signing up for a CPR certification class in your area.</br></br>

<b>Use AED :</b> If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available and the person is unconscious, begin CPR while the device is retrieved and set up. Attach the device and follow instructions that will be provided by the AED after it has evaluated the person\'s condition.
