<hr>
<b>Cancers are a large family of diseases that involve abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.They form a subset of neoplasms. A neoplasm or tumor is a group of cells that have undergone unregulated growth and will often form a mass or lump, but may be distributed diffusely.</b></br></br>
<b><font color ="black">Signs and symptoms</font></b></br></br>
When cancer begins, it produces no symptoms. Signs and symptoms appear as the mass grows or ulcerates. The findings that result depend on the cancer\'s type and location. Few symptoms are specific. Cancer is a <b>"great imitator"</b>. Thus, it is common for people diagnosed with cancer to have been treated for other diseases, which were hypothesized to be causing their symptoms.</br></br>
<b><font color ="black">Causes</font></b></br></br>
The majority of cancers, some 90–95% of cases, are due to environmental factors. The remaining 5–10% are due to inherited genetics. Environmental, as used by cancer researchers, means any cause that is not inherited genetically, such as lifestyle, economic and behavioral factors and not merely pollution.Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include tobacco (25–30%), diet and obesity (30–35%), infections (15–20%), radiation (both ionizing and non-ionizing, up to 10%), stress, lack of physical activity and environmental pollutants.</br></br>
<b><font color ="black">Types of Cancer</font></b></br></br>
<ul>
<li><font color ="blue">Carcinoma</font>: Cancers derived from epithelial cells. This group includes many of the most common cancers and include nearly all those in the <b>breast, prostate, lung, pancreas and colon</b>.</li>
<li><font color ="blue">Sarcoma</font>: Cancers arising from <b>connective tissue</b> (bone, cartilage, fat, nerve), each of which develops from cells originating in mesenchymal cells outside the bone marrow.</li>
<li><font color ="blue">Lymphoma and leukemia:</font>These two classes arise from hematopoietic (blood-forming) cells that leave the marrow and tend to mature in the lymph nodes and blood, respectively.</li>
<li><font color ="blue">Germ cell tumor </font>: Cancers derived from <b> pluripotent</b> cells, most often presenting in the testicle or the <b>ovary</b> (seminoma and dysgerminoma, respectively).</li>
<li><font color ="blue">Blastoma </font>: Cancers derived from immature <b> "precursor" </b>cells or embryonic tissue.</li>
</ul>

The two types of lung cancer, which grow and spread differently, are small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer deaths in both men and women.Cigarette smoking is the principal risk factor for development of lung cancer.

<b>Skin Cancer :</b></br>

Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells. It occurs when unrepaired DNA damage to skin cells (most often caused by ultraviolet radiation from sunshine or tanning beds) triggers mutations, or genetic defects, that lead the skin cells to multiply rapidly and form malignant tumors.

<b>Ovarian Cancer :</b></br>

"Ovarian cancer" includes several different types of cancer that all arise from cells of the ovary.Most commonly, tumors arise from the epithelium, or lining cells, of the ovary.These are all considered to be one disease process. There is also an entity called ovarian low malignant potential tumor; these tumores have some of the microscopic features of a cancer.

Breast cancer is a kind of cancer that develops from breast cells.Breast cancer usually starts off in the inner lining of milk ducts or the lobules that supply them with milk. A malignant tumor can spread to other parts of the body. A breast cancer that started off in the lobules is known as lobular carcinoma, while one that developed from the ducts is called ductal carcinoma.
The vast majority of breast cancer cases occur in females.</br>
<b>Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in females worldwide</b>. It accounts for 16% of all female cancers and 22.9% of invasive cancers in women. 18.2% of all cancer deaths worldwide, including both males and females, are from breast cancer. 
</p></div></br></br>

<b>Some types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope, such as giant cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma.</b></br></br>
<b><font color ="black">Prevention</font></b></br></br>
Greater than 30% of cancer deaths could be prevented by avoiding risk factors including: tobacco, excess weight/obesity, insufficient diet, physical inactivity, alcohol, sexually transmitted infections and air pollution.Not all environmental causes are controllable, such as naturally occurring background radiation and cancers caused through hereditary genetic disorders and thus are not preventable via personal behavior.
