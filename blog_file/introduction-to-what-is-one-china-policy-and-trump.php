Over the years, the U.S. has successfully maintained an unofficial relationship with Taiwan. The United States, recognizes that Chinese on either side of the Taiwan region maintains that there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of that China.

The U.S. is Taiwan’s second-largest trading partner and Taiwan ranks as the ninth-largest trading partner for the U.S. According to the State Department, companies from Taiwan employ more than 12,000 workers in the United States. With all these, the U.S government does not support independence for Taiwan, now a democracy that elects its own president and parliament. U.S. relations with the island are governed by the 1979 Taiwan relations act, which outlines the U.S. commitment to help Taiwan maintain its military defense.
