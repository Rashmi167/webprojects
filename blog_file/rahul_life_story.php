<b><b>Rahul Gandhi</b></b> was born in Delhi on 19 June 1970, as the first of the two children of Rajiv Gandhi, who later became the Prime Minister of India, and Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, who later became President of Indian National Congress, and as the grandson of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He is also the great-grandson of India\'s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Priyanka Vadra is his younger sister and Robert Vadra is his brother-in-law.</br></br>

Gandhi attended St. Columba\'s School, Delhi before entering The Doon School in Dehradun, Uttarakhand from 1981 to 1983. Meanwhile, his father had joined politics and became the Prime Minister on 31 October 1984 when Indira Gandhi was assassinated. Due to the security threats faced by Indira Gandhi\'s family from Sikh extremists, <b>Rahul Gandhi</b> and his sister, Priyanka were home-schooled thereafter.</br></br>

<b>Rahul Gandhi</b> joined St. Stephen\'s College, Delhi in 1989 for his undergraduate education but moved to Harvard University after he completed the first year examinations. In 1991, after Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) during an election rally, he shifted to Rollins College due to security concerns and completed his B.A. in 1994. During this period, he assumed the pseudonym Raul Vinci and his identity was known only to the university officials and security agencies.He further went on to obtain an M.Phil from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1995.</br></br>

After graduation, <b>Rahul Gandhi</b> worked at the Monitor Group, a management consulting firm, in London.</br</br>

In 2002, he was one of the directors of Mumbai-based technology outsourcing firm Backops Services Private Ltd. In 2004, Gandhi told the press that he had a Spanish girlfriend, Veronique, an architect, living in Venezuela, whom he had met while studying in England.
</br></br>

In March 2004, Gandhi announced his entry into politics by announcing that he would contest the May 2004 elections, standing for his father\'s former constituency of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh in the Lok Sabha, India\'s lower house of Parliament.The seat had been held by his mother until she transferred to the neighbouring seat of Rae Bareilly. </br></br>

The Congress had been doing poorly in Uttar Pradesh, holding only 10 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state at the time.At the time, this move generated surprise among political commentators, who had regarded his sister Priyanka as being the more charismatic and likely to succeed. It generated speculation that the presence of a young member of India\'s most famous political family would reinvigorate the Congress party\'s political fortunes among India\'s youthful population. </br></br>

In his first interview with foreign media, Gandhi portrayed himself as a uniter of the country and condemned "divisive" politics in India, saying that he would try to reduce caste and religious tensions.Gandhi won, retaining the family stronghold with a victory margin of over 100,000. Until 2006 he held no other office.
</br></br>

Gandhi and his sister, Priyanka managed their mother\'s campaign for re-election to Rae Bareilly in 2006, which was won with a victory margin of over 400,000 votes. He was a prominent figure in the Congress campaign for the 2007 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections; Congress, however, won only 22 seats of the 403 seats with 8.53% of votes.</br></r>

Gandhi was appointed General Secretary of the All India Congress Committee on 24 September 2007 in a reshuffle of the party secretariat. In the same reshuffle, he was also given charge of the Indian Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India. In 2008, senior Congress leader Veerappa Moily mentioned "Rahul-as-PM" idea when the PM of India Manmohan Singh was still abroad. He was elevated to the position of the vice-president of the party in January 2013.</br></br>

<h2>Youth politics</h2>

In September 2007 when he was appointed general secretary in charge of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Gandhi promised to reform youth politics. In his attempt to prove himself thus, in November 2008 Gandhi held interviews at his 12 Tughlak Lane residence in New Delhi to handpick at least 40 people who will make up the think-tank of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC), an organisation that he has been keen to transform since he was appointed general secretary in September 2007.</br></br>

Under Gandhi, the IYC and NSUI have seen a dramatic increase in members from 200,000 to 2.5 million. The Indian Express wrote in 2011, "Three years later, as another organisational reshuffle is in the offing, Gandhi\'s dream remains unrealised with party veterans manipulating internal elections in the Youth Congress and a host of people with questionable background gaining entry into it."
