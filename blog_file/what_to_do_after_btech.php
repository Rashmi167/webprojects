For many students about to complete their undergraduation in engineering, the next step to the higher education namely Post Graduation is not an easy choice. Many are left wondering what to pursue next after B.Tech – management through MBA or carry forward the technical qualifications with an M.Tech?</br>
Students have these common questions - </br></br>

1. How should a student choose between higher studies (tech), MBA, or a job?</br></br>

2. When: Immediately or after a few years of work experience?</br></br>

3. Where: Abroad? In India, but in top colleges only? Or are local colleges also OK?</br></br></br></br><hr></br>

<p><strong>MBA is very much popular course with students IIM&#8217;s (Indian Institute of Management) conducts a entrance exams for admission in Indian Top level Institutes which we named as CAT(Common Entrance Test).</strong></p></br></br>

<p>Thoughts behind why students going more into MBA&#8217;s after graduation is simply the factor of Non-Technical source including that <strong>MBA secures future in Industries and No-technical workouts</strong> which students can Opt out also,</p>
<p>We should have a bright phase of M.Tech Pg course i..e., as <strong>M.Tech deals with Technical field</strong> that will  take you to deep into engineering studies and its components.</p>
<h2>Main Field which M.Tech or MBA covers:-</h2>
<h3>MBA covers those Fields:-</h3>
<ul>
<li>Banking</li>
<li>Managements</li>
<li>Finance</li>
<li>Consultancy</li>
</ul>
<p>All Other Non-technical former workouts are considered under MBA programs and Jobs.</p>
<h3>M.Tech Cover Those Fields:-</h3>
<ul>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Engineering equipment</li>
<li>Academics</li>
<li>Developments</li>
</ul>
</br></br></br></br><hr>

<h2>Comparison in M.Tech and MBA:-</h2><hr>
<p>MBA no doubts has a large quantity of Jobs and major areas for building a fabulous career which can promise them a secured and blushing Future.  The Employment Level and Salary packages in MBA is definitely having a upper hand over M.Tech graduates as MBA Students will start with a trademark salary of around <b>80 K to 1 lack bucks per month which is a huge amount in Indian currency where as in US $ they will be earning around 1000$ per Week. </b></p>

Let us say <b>you are a civil engineer and have learnt how to &quot;in principle&quot; design a bridge. And now a new bridge needs to be built outside your town. Let us look at what challenges the engineers and managers likely to deal with</b><br /><br />

<b>Engineers :</b><br />
<ul><li>What are the water speeds, water temperatures, air speeds</li><li>How prone is the area to earthquakes</li><li>What is the geological composition of the rock bed below the river</li><li>What kind of cross section would best suit the wind conditions</li><li>What kind of bridge structure would be appropriate given the river bed span</li><li>What should be the exact dimensions of the bridge</li><li>Most importantly - the actual operations of then taking the design and building the bridge and dealing with the operational challenges that come with it (raw materials different from specifications etc.)</li></ul>etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />

<b>Managers :</b><br /><ul><li>How will the bridge building be funded</li><li>How much will the local economy be benefited by the bridge</li><li>How much is the maximum acceptable toll given the income distribution of the local population</li><li>Can I divert traffic from other bridges nearby to increase toll collections</li><li>Can I build other attractive things like multiplexes, food courts, spanking highways to help attract traffic from adjoining roads</li><li>Where can I hire the right engineers to build a sound bridge. How do I get the right consulting teams to support them</li><li>Since the municipal corporation does not have money what is the best way to raise money - debt, government grants etc.</li><li>How can I as the bridge builder maximise my profits</li><li>At what point can I start funnelling the revenues from this project to start building even more bridges</li><li>Operational challenges such as employee turnover, interest rate fluctuations, political environment changes etc. etc.</li></ul>
<br /><br />

At last we would conclude that Students should use these above information for there future Post graduation studies programs but every one should prefer there “Taste of Interest” in Field they enjoy to work it on. If a students loves working in industry and managements we must go for MBA’s but Students who feel there heart going in a side technical workouts and feel comfortable in doing behind the scene workouts and provide people a new  Generation Technology.
