You might have observed that well water is felt cold in summer and hot in winter season. And you might have wondered why this happens! The reason of this well water phenomenon is very simple.
</br></br>
Actually, temperature of underground water remains almost constant through out the year because water table is far below from the surface of Earth. Sun is not able to heat up such deep water. The temperature of underground water is almost 10-20 degree Celsius. It can be different for different geographical regions. So, if temperature outside is suppose 40 degree Celsius but underground water has only 15 °C, you will feel it as cold. In winter, if temperature on surface of Earth is 0 or below 0 °C, well water with approx. 15 degree Celsius temperature will definitely be felt as warm.
</br></br>
The same phenomenon also happens in case of tube well water and the reason remains the same. Tube well which is used for irrigation purposes and to supply water to towns is a type of well having a narrow pipe going down the Earth to underground aquifer. Water is then pulled up using water pumps.
</br></br>
Sometimes, the underground water which is pumped out is very hot. It is a rare case but naturally possible. It happens when underground water comes in contact with burning hot rocks or magma. Hot water falls and hot natural fountains are also formed due to the result of same contact between water and magma or hot rocks.
