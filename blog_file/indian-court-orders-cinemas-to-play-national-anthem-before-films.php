<h2><b>National Anthem Controversy In India (2016)</b></h2>
<hr>


India’s supreme court has ordered cinemas across the country to play the national anthem before film screenings to encourage citizens to “feel this is my country and this is my motherland”. The court also directed that moviegoers should “stand up in respect” while the anthem is played.

The decision by the country’s highest cour is one of number of recent developments that have drawn India’s cinema industry into disputes over patriotism and national identity.
<hr>

The panel of judges was responding to public interest litigation that claimed the national anthem was regularly being dishonoured, including in cinemas, where it was already required to be played before films in the states of Maharashtra and Goa.

“People should feel that they live in a nation and show respect to the national anthem and the national flag,” the court said.
<hr>

Too much disrespect of national symbols had been indulged in the name of “individually perceived notions of freedom”, it added.
<hr>

The Indian flag should be displayed and the doors of cinemas should be closed during the rendition to prevent people from entering or leaving, the court said.
<hr>

It also banned anybody from dramatising the national song, printing it on an “undesirable object”, singing an abridged version or making money from it.
<hr>

The song was last ordered to be played in cinemas in India after the country’s 1962 war with China but the practice was discontinued in 1975 after most moviegoers ignored it.
<hr>

The court directed the Centre to give wide publicity to its order and send it to the chief secretaries of states and union territories.
<hr>

The national anthem was penned by India’s first Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore in 1911 and the first of five stanzas adopted as the country’s national anthem in 1950.
