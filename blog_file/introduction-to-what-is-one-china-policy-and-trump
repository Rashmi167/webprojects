Taiwan as been based been ruled by different countries at various times in history. First, it was briefly ruled by Dutch (1624–1662), the Spanish the (1626–1642, northern Taiwan only). Including France over northern Taiwan between 1884-85. Of all countries who ruled Taiwan, the Japanese stands out. The Japanese ruled Taiwan for over half a century, precisely between 1895–1945. In all, the sovereignty of Taiwan is left in a state of hullabaloo.

One China policy draws on the assertion that only one country represent China. It argues against the recognition of Taiwan. Taiwan independent movement have argued against the “One China” and have clamored to fabricate Taiwanizatilon – a different identity from China and further aims to establish “Republic of Taiwan”.

The situation facing China and Taiwan is not new, a similar experience holds between North Korea and South Korea

Over the years, the U.S. has successfully maintained an unofficial relationship with Taiwan. The United States, recognizes that Chinese on either side of the Taiwan region maintains that there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of that China.

The One China Policy is the bedrock of US – China relations and as the People Republic of China stated:
</hr>

Taiwan is part of the sacred territory of the People’s Republic of China. It is the lofty duty of the entire Chinese people, including our compatriots in Taiwan, to accomplish the great task of reunifying the motherland.
</hr>

Further, China makes it clear that any country that wishes to establish diplomatic relationship with her must first discontinue any formal relationship with the ROC.

The “non-recognition of the Taiwanese government is a prerequisite for conducting formal diplomatic relations with the PRC —in effect forcing other governments to choose between Beijing and Taipei.”, says The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs.

Hence, there have been rattling over the congratulatory message Trump received from the Taiwan leader, Tsai Ing-wen. The call was indeed historical. It was the first such call since President Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979. China response to the call was to send an official complaint to Washington.

In an interview broadcast conducted recently, Trump mentioned that the United States would not necessarily be bound by the one-China policy — the diplomatic understanding that underpins ties between Washington and Beijing and that leaves China’s ­rival Taiwan on the diplomatic sidelines with the United States. Trump seems less enthusiastic over China, he commented during an interview, “I mean, look,” he continued, “we’re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation; with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don’t tax them; with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn’t be doing; and, frankly, with not helping us at all with North Korea.” Adding to this, during the election campaign, Trump outrightly blamed China as the cause of climate change.

The U.S. is Taiwan’s second-largest trading partner and Taiwan ranks as the ninth-largest trading partner for the U.S. According to the State Department, companies from Taiwan employ more than 12,000 workers in the United States. With all these, the U.S government does not support independence for Taiwan, now a democracy that elects its own president and parliament. U.S. relations with the island are governed by the 1979 Taiwan relations act, which outlines the U.S. commitment to help Taiwan maintain its military defense. Last year, the U.S. approved $1.8 billion in arms sales to Taipei. In this era when Taiwan hopes for a better relationship with the USA beyond exciting unofficial relations. This aim, coupled with the call received from the Taiwan Leader, a pro-independence party member have created a fuss on U.S commitment to the One – China policy under Trump administration.

The diplomatic balance over Taiwan is so delicate that some analysts fear Trump could be starting a confrontation that could easily spin out of control, endanger other crucial areas of the US-China relationship and even risk a military clash in the Pacific. The issue is highly sensitive for the US China relations, considering the fact that Taiwan and China has experienced friction over the years. The U.S has managed it’s relationship with Taiwan by The policy of Deliberate Ambiguity.
</hr>

Taiwan question continues to be unanswered. Overtime, the matter has been left with many ambiguity. It has never been expedient than in this time, for the international community to define the status of Taiwan. This implies, a formal Declaration of the status of Taiwan that would define the legal or future status of Taiwan. Rather than, leaving each group and people to interpret the state in a way that is politically acceptable to its opinion.
