<b>Ramdev was associated with anti corruption and was involved in the Jan Lokpal agitation, which was focused on promoting an independent body that would investigate alleged corruption.</b></br></br>


Ramdev declared he would go on an anshan (indefinite fast) on 4 June 2011, at Ramlila Ground to pressure the government to root out corruption and repatriate the black money. After this declaration the government was said to have set up a panel to suggest steps to curb black money and its transfer abroad, in an apparent bid to placate Ramdev.</br><hr>

He was banned from entering Delhi for 15 days. On reaching Haridwar, Ramdev declared that his fast would continue.</br></br><hr></br></br>


Baba Ramdev called off his six-day fast at Delhi\'s Ambedkar stadium on 14 August 2012 and said he was returning to Haridwar. Seeking the defeat of the Congress in 2014, he said, "Congress hatao, desh bachao (Remove Congress, save the country)", adding that except for the Congress all parties were together on the issue of black money.</br></br><hr></br></br>


Ramdev "detests gays". In July 2009, when Delhi High Court gave a verdict under decriminalising homosexuality in Delhi, Ramdev said, "This verdict of the court will encourage criminality and sick mentality.This is breaking the family system in India. Homosexuality is not natural and can be treated. If the government brings this law, I will take this matter to the streets of Delhi in protest."</br></br> In 2011 he petitioned the court to overturn the ruling.He said that "[Gay sex] is against our Vedic culture"and that "I consider homosexuality unnatural and a mental disorder. A bad habit. Many people acquire bad habits and get addicted to them." Ramdev has said that he can "cure" homosexuals within six months using "yoga, pranayam and other meditation techniques".
