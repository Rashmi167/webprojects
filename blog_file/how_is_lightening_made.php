<b>How is lightning made? People used to make up stories to answer that question. Today, science tells us how.</b></br></br>

You have heard of Ben Franklin. Did you know he flew a kite during a thunderstorm? He wanted to prove that lightning is a form of electricity. We know now that flying a kite in a storm is not safe. But, Ben was right. Lightning is a form of electricity. How does this "electricity" form?</br>';

echo'When cold air and warm air meet, the warm air goes up. It makes thunderstorm clouds! The cold air has ice crystals. The warm air has water droplets. During the storm, the droplets and crystals bump together and move apart in the air. This rubbing makes static electrical charges in the clouds.

<hr>

Just like a battery, these clouds have a "plus" end and a "minus" end. The plus, or positive, charges in the cloud are at the top. The minus, or negative, charges are at the bottom. When the charge at the bottom gets strong enough, the cloud lets out energy.

<hr>

The energy goes through the air. It goes to a place that has the opposite charge. This lightning bolt of energy that is let out is called a leader stroke. It can go from the cloud to the ground. Or, a leader stroke can go from the cloud to another cloud. No one is sure why lightning bolts follow a zigzag path as they move. The main bolt or stroke will go back up to the cloud.</br>';

<h3>Be Safe in a Storm</h3><hr>

Lightning is dangerous. Here are some safety rules.</br></br>

Animation of cartoon mole hit by lightning so that you can see his skeleton</br>
</br></br>

<ul>
<li>Stay away from open spaces. But, do not stand under a tree. The best place is inside a building.</li>
<li>If you are swimming, get out of the water. Get out as soon as you see a storm coming. The storm may seem far away, but lightning can travel over 20 miles! </li>
<li>During a thunderstorm, shut off or unplug all electrical items. Do not use the phone.</li>
<li>Never walk in a thunderstorm carrying a metal pole. Don\'t even carry an umbrella!</li>
<li>How will you know if a lightning strike is near you? You will feel the hair on your head or body start to stand up. If this happens, go to a safe place. Go quickly! If there is no safe place near, get as close to the ground as you can.</li>
</ul>
