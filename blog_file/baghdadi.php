The United States has also accused al-Baghdadi of kidnapping, enslaving, and repeatedly raping an American citizen who was later killed.Over time, there have been a number of reports of al-Baghdadi\'s death or injury; however, none have been verified.
</br></br>


<b><u>Background</b></u><hr/>
Al-Baghdadi is believed to have been born near Samarra, Iraq, in 1971. In 2004, he lived in a room attached to a small local mosque in Tobchi, a poor neighbourhood on the western fringes of Baghdad, inhabited by both Shia and Sunni Muslims.
</br></br>
Ahmed al-Dabash, the leader of the <b>Islamic Army of Iraq</b> and a contemporary of al-Baghdadi who fought against the allied invasion in 2003, gave a description of al-Baghdadi that matched that of the Tobchi residents:</br></br>
<i> I was with Baghdadi at the Islamic University. We studied the same course, but he wasn\'t a friend. He was quiet, and retiring. He spent time alone ... I used to know all the leaders (of the insurgency) personally. Zarqawi (the former leader of al-Qaeda) was closer than a brother to me ... But I didn\'t know Baghdadi. He was insignificant. He used to lead prayer in a mosque near my area. No one really noticed him</i>
</br></br>
He obtained a BA, MA, and PhD in Islamic studies from the <b>Islamic University of Baghdad.</b></br></br>
<b><u>Person Life</b></u><hr/>
Little is known about al-Baghdadi\'s family and sources provide conflicting information. Reuters, quoting tribal sources in Iraq, reports Baghdadi has three wives, two Iraqis and one Syrian. The Iraqi Interior Ministry has said, "There is no wife named Saja al-Dulaimi" and that al-Baghdadi has two wives, Asma Fawzi Mohammed al-Dulaimi and Israa Rajab Mahal A-Qaisi. However, in 2016 Fox News reported, based on local media, that Saja al-Dulaimi is al-Baghdadi\'s most powerful wife.</br></br>
<b><u>Children</b></u><hr/></br>
According to a reporter for The Guardian, al-Baghdadi married in Iraq around the year 2000 after finishing his doctorate. The son of this marriage was aged 11 years old in 2014.</br>

A four- to six-year-old girl who was detained in Lebanon in 2014 with Saja al-Dulaimi is allegedly al-Baghdadi\'s daughter.</br></br>

<b><u>Reports of paralysis, wounds or death</b></u><hr/>
According to media reports, al-Baghdadi was wounded on 18 March 2015 during a coalition airstrike on the al-Baaj District, in the <b>Nineveh Governorate</b>, near the Syrian border. His wounds were apparently so serious that the top ISIL leaders had a meeting to discuss who would replace him if he died. According to reports, by 22 April al-Baghdadi had not yet recovered enough from his injuries to resume daily control of ISIL.</br></br>
The <b> US Pentagon </b>said that al-Baghdadi had not been the target of the airstrikes and "we have no reason to believe it was Baghdadi.</br></br>
<b>In April 2015, The Guardian reported that al-Baghdadi was recovering from the severe injuries which he had received during the airstrike on 18 March 2015, in a part of Mosul. It was also reported that a <font color = "blue">spinal injury</font> which had left him paralyzed meant that he might never be able to fully resume direct command of ISIL.</b></br></br>

On 14 May 2015, ISIL released an audio message which it claimed was from al-Baghdadi. In the recording, al-Baghdadi urged Muslims to emigrate to the Islamic State, and to join the fight in Iraq and Syria. In the recording, he also condemned the Saudi involvement in Yemen, and claimed that the conflict would lead to the end of the Saudi royal family\'s rule.</br></br>
On 20 July 2015, The New York Times wrote that rumors that al-Baghdadi had been killed or injured earlier in the year had been "dispelled"</br></br>
On 9 June 2016, Iraqi State TV claimed that al-Baghdadi had been wounded in a US airstrike in Northern Iraq. Coalition spokesmen said they could not confirm the reports.</br></br>
On 14 June 2016, several Middle Eastern media outlets claimed that al-Baghdadi had been killed in a US airstrike in Raqqa on 12 June. Coalition spokesmen said they could not confirm the reports.
