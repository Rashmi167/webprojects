<u><b>What is Surrogacy </b></u></br></br>

When a couple wants a baby but is unable to have a child because either or both partners are medically unfit to conceive, another woman is artificially inseminated with the sperm of the father. She then carries the child full term and delivers it for the couple. In such a case, the surrogate mother is the biological mother of the child. In instances when the father\'s sperm cannot be used, a donor sperm can also be used. This is traditional surrogacy.</br></br>

Here is also gestational surrogacy, where in eggs from the mother are fertilised with the father\'s/donor\'s sperm and then the embryo is placed into the uterus of the surrogate, who carries the child to term and delivers it. In this case, the biological mother is still the woman whose eggs are used, while the surrogate is called the birth mother.</br></br>
