<h2>Why does Kashmir, being the only Muslim dominated state?</h2>
Why can\'t a non-Kashmiri buy land in Kashmir? Understanding Article-370
<img src="/blog_img/artcl370.jpg" height="auto" width="100%" /><hr>

During accession of Kashmir Nehru forced Maharaja hari singh who was the ruler of Kashmir at the time of accession to transfer power to the hands of Sheikh Abdullah. On the request of Sheikh Abdullah it was decided that the State Assembly will take the final decision on the accession and it was done to appease the Muslim society in Kashmir.The question arose as to what should be done till the Assembly took the final decision ? For this period Article 370 was incorporated in the Constitution as a temporary measure. But even when the State Assembly ratified the state\'s accession to India, the Article was not scrapped.</br></br></br>

<h3>SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES</h3>
It is because of this Article that <b>the Government of India cannot enforce any law connected with Jammu and Kashmir without the approval of the State Government.</b></br>
Its dangerous consequences have been witnessed in recent years when the law prohibiting misuse of religious places could not be extended to Jammu and Kashmir and even after the independence the ignoble thing happened in Kashmir where hundreds of temples were destroyed and  Hindus were victimised and subjected to cruelties.</br>
J&K is even having a separate flag and separate symbol.

<h3><b>STATE FLAG OF KASHMIR</b></h3>
There is only one system of citizenship for the people of the country but in case of Jammu and Kashmir, it is dual citizenship, one of the state and the other of India.Indian citizen does not have the right to have property and the right to vote in Jammu and Kashmir.Even the wealth tax cannot be imposed in the state.It is because of Article 370 that political groupism receives encouragement and no local nationalist Government can remain durable if it is not the product of anti-national elements.Burning of the national flag is not a cognizable offence in Kashmir because there cannot be proper arrangement for the basic duties enshrined in the Constitution under which the tricolour, the national anthem and the national symbol have to be shown due respect.Under the umbrella of Article 370 the fundamentalists have received strength in their campaign for Islamisation.</br></br></br>

 Instead of bringing the people to the national mainstream, we have, in comparison to other states, given unlimited rights to the people which have made them a pampered lot. People of Kashmir became suspicious about the accession and the anti- national elements got an opportunity for launching an open disinformation campaign against India. Pakistan supported these separatist organisations. The result was that Kashmiri youths picked up arms against India and forced over three lakh Hindu patriots to leave their houses and property in Kashmir and live in the plains a life of misery. It is the tale of local versus non-local who are not state subjects. They do not enjoy any political and economic rights. Their wards cannot get admission in the colleges in Kashmir. Article 370 has violated the principle of Indian citizenship. It is quite evident that Article 370 has not integrated Jammu and Kashmir with India but it has delinked it.Sheikh Abdullah adopted a resolution and the wording of the resolution clearly indicates how Kashmiri leaders have been working for making the Muslim society anti-India and pro-Pakistan and for this the leaders took the refuge under Article 370. The resolution had made a mention of this Article and said:</br></br>

<b>"Jammu and Kashmir state has not yet acceded to any of the two dominions, India and Pakistan. Therefore, it will not be right to call Pakistani invasion on Jammu and Kashmir as an attack on India."</b></br></br></br>

what exactly is Article 370 and why is the Article so important to keep Jammu and Kashmir as a part of India? Here are 10 facts that explain why:</br></br></br>

1. According to the Constitution of India, Article 370 provides temporary provisions to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, granting it special autonomy.</br></br>
2. The article says that the provisions of Article 238, which was omitted from the Constitution in 1956 when Indian states were reorganised, shall not apply to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.</br></br>
3. Dr BR Ambedkar, the principal drafter of the Indian Constitution, had refused to draft Article 370.</br></br>
4. In 1949, the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had directed Kashmiri leader Sheikh Abdullah to consult Ambedkar (then law minister) to prepare the draft of a suitable article to be included in the Constitution.</br></br>
5. Article 370 was eventually drafted by Gopalaswami Ayyangar</br></br>
6. Ayyangar was a minister without portfolio in the first Union Cabinet of India. He was also a former Diwan to Maharajah Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir</br></br>
7. Article 370 is drafted in Amendment of the Constitution section, in Part XXI, under Temporary and Transitional Provisions.</br></br>
8. The original draft explained "the Government of the State means the person for the time being recognised by the President as the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers for the time being in office under the Maharaja\'s Proclamation dated the fifth day of March, 1948."</br></br>
9. On November 15, 1952, it was changed to "the Government of the State means the person for the time being recognised by the President on the recommendation of the Legislative Assembly of the State as the Sadr-i-Riyasat (now Governor) of Jammu and Kashmir, acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers of the State for the time being in office."</br></br>
